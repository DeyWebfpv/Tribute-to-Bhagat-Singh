    <h3 id="headline">Here's a tribute to his great credentials achieved.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A man courageous and brave,
Had a role in removing the word slave,
From India and freeing it,
From the merciless rule of the British.</strong></li>
      <li>
        <strong>He sacrificed his life,
In the struggle to make India free,
A man devoted to his country,
Fought hard and made history.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>While he was in jail he started,
A hunger strike and fasted,
For 116 days straight,
Without caring about his fate.</strong> - 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Arrested for the murder,
Of a British police officer,
John Saunders, he was arrested,
Subsequently hanged and convicted.
</strong> 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>He was just 23 years of age,
When he was convicted and hanged,
By the merciless British’s rage,
He will be remembered till everlasting days.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>When he was hanged,
He just smiled and passed,
Away from this world,
Leaving his revolting words.</strong> 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A man courageous and brave,
Was not the British’s slave,
Devoted to his country,
He fought hard and made history.</strong> 
      </li>
      
    </ul>

        "Bhagat Singh became a popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him, "Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name."
